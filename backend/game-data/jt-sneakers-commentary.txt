you looking up to him what was it like
1:43
you know seeing him playing in the ogs
1:45
and like before even like you got to
1:48
design the player gosh yeah I have
1:50
posters of MJ on my walls growing up in
1:53
Tennessee and and not having access to
1:57
sneakers as much as you know a huge
2:01
metropolitan area right you know I would
2:03
have to say find a way to save up okay
2:06
to go to Foot Locker to wait in line and
2:11
I used to every year I would I started
2:13
cutting grass okay on on my street with
2:16
everybody so I could try to you know
2:19
save money up 10 bucks a lawn and I
2:23
would I would try to save up and save up
2:25
to go wait in line at Foot Locker and
2:27
I'll never forget when the the black and
2:29
around Olive nines maybe yeah yeah yeah
2:32
when they came out like we all wanted
2:34
those so good such an underrated pair
2:36
underrated pair well and also growing up
2:39
in a rural area it was a sneaker you
2:41
could wear and not feel so bad if it got
2:44
well it kind of looks like a Timberland
2:45
that's why totally and and I love those
2:47
yeah totally which when they winterized
2:49
that shoe I was like what took them so
2:52
long who who just thought of this right
2:55
before we're going to talk a lot of
2:56
Jordans but I really like early 2000s
2:58
cuz you were Weare ing kind of like Cool
3:02
Air Maxes you were really in like your
3:03
Air Max bag air max 98 oh yeah what
3:07
about like that Air Max era what do you
3:09
remember about that well it's kind of
3:12
ironic that the two sneakers that had
3:14
the most effect on me when I first saw
3:18
them were the threes okay and Air Max
3:21
yeah and same bubble almost and so to
3:24
find out that the same guy yes was
3:26
behind was the genius behind yeah your
3:28
boy now yeah well yeah yeah I have a
3:31
story yeah but yeah I went through a big
3:34
Air Max phase just because like super
3:37
comfortable shoe yeah um I have big
3:39
arches in my feet okay so I would wear
3:42
them on stage when I could because they
3:44
were they just supported my feet and
3:46
when they used to you know when they
3:47
first sold them they came with the
3:48
little the little wedge yep I remember
3:51
all this the arch W it was a styrofoam
3:53
it was blue and pink like that was going
3:55
to really save the arch you just threw
3:57
them out you threw them out with like
3:58
the gel that you can't eat the little
4:00
things that are pois I I I would spend
4:01
so much time trying to put them the
4:04
right way in the yeah so another moment
4:07
Big Pop Culture moment big Music Moment
4:09
do you know the significance of these do
4:11
you remember oh God think about
4:15
it where did I wear these byebye bye
4:19
video matching think the whole crew
4:21
matched that's right whole crew indiglow
4:24
14s 2000 they came out you matched them
4:28
up yeah and that's why in sync is the
4:30
greatest boy band of all time look there
4:32
we go there we go but like was Jordan
4:35
brand seating you guys or were you going
4:36
out or do you remember complex rated
4:39
like the best moments in music videos
4:41
and that made it oh wow it's definitely
4:42
like a sneaker culture moment this is a
4:45
deep cut this is like a bide on a Stevie
4:47
Wonder Al you know what I mean like gosh
4:51
you're right and we all had them very
4:54
good to dance and good com shoot and
4:57
then another thing I like back in the
4:59
day celebrity games charity games you
5:01
always brought it you always brought you
5:04
always brought it and it was like you
5:05
were wearing like early 2000 basketball
5:08
shoes that like Dirk nitzky was wearing
5:11
right right so like and true blue 3es
5:13
what about those games that you remember
5:15
like I'm definitely going to wear dope
5:16
sneakers yeah yeah well also too I was a
5:19
big Penny fan okay Memphis right big
5:22
Penny Hardway fan getting the deposits
5:25
were were like a big deal too okay but I
5:28
never I don't think I ever was I could I
5:30
could ever find the blue and black was
5:31
always the white oral yeah the original
5:34
I think I was just at that time I was
5:36
mixing it up and wearing just like
5:38
anything that caught my eye got it were
5:40
boxes coming in at that point uh no not
5:43
as much not as much not even for the
5:46
videos you think costume designer or
5:48
yeah my my yeah maybe okay yeah like if
5:51
there was a stylist or something we were
5:53
able to get what had just come out at
5:56
the time okay but um yeah yeah I I not
6:01
the plug that I have now okay
6:04
[Music]
6:10
okay we want to talk Legends Of Summer
6:13
Don't Throw yeah well I'm going to catch
6:15
you could throw Legends Of Summer these
6:17
are two yes yeah so this wrapped up yeah
6:21
one two three yeah yeah so we did we did
6:23
an all red one we also did one was like
6:26
this I don't even know how to describe
6:28
it we called them the Dorothy they look
6:31
like the the red slippers you know it
6:33
literally like somebody littered them
6:35
you know what I mean and um and yeah I
6:37
really wanted I mean the three has
6:39
always been one of my favorite shoes and
6:41
the two to me has always been the most
6:43
underrated that's what a lot of people
6:44
say of Jordans that's just my personal
6:46
opinion and so the color of this shoe is
6:52
actually the uh exact same color of the
6:56
stage Jay and I have put together for of
7:00
the summer so when I wore it on the
7:01
stage it actually like almost
7:04
camouflaged itself makes sense and um if
7:07
you kind of look down on the bottom it's
7:09
got a reference to suit and Thai which
7:11
which was a song at that time suit and
7:13
Tai and holy grail and yeah I wanted all
7:16
different materials on all the pieces of
7:18
architecture of the shoe so and the
7:21
shoes you know we couldn't even Source
7:22
them you had to bring them you had to
7:24
bring them well yeah as you I said you
7:27
have them our friend mayor who had the
7:29
ones he hooked up the the two-color one
7:32
but you bought them from home because
7:33
these stores which has virtually every
7:35
sneaker doesn't even have them but you
7:37
also said you don't even have that many
7:39
pairs they're going for like $20,000
7:42
what happened to all your pairs I know
7:44
well a lot of my boys a lot of my
7:46
friends we had same same size okay so
7:50
when when uh you know Jordan brand made
7:54
me my sort of stash yeah of of them I
7:58
just wanted to share with all of my
7:59
friends and I think I literally only
8:01
have one pair of the all red ones wow at
8:05
home got to keep those I know I will it
8:07
will
8:09
[Music]
8:16
yeah all good Joe I'm good you're living
8:19
on the edge man I haven't dropped I
8:21
don't think I ever dropped one wow I'm
8:24
going to drop the next one you just
8:26
that's like he hasn't miss a free throw
8:28
all night yeah CL
8:31
exactly we got to talk the Super Bowl
8:33
moment okay you debut these and this
8:36
pair is really special this is cuz these
8:39
right are but little different in the
8:41
details you if you notice these you get
8:43
the you get the Nike yes and this was
8:46
you know obviously if you know you know
8:48
it's you know if you know you know this
8:52
was the original design for the three
8:56
and that Tinker you know said you know
8:58
the jump man logo is big enough to live
9:00
on its own and we should take the Nike
9:03
Swoosh off which I'm sure was very
9:06
controversial right conversation at the
9:08
time I I would not want to be in that
9:10
board meeting exactly but so we talked
9:13
about like what if we brought the
9:15
original design back for the Super Bowl
9:18
performance and I I said I'm good with
9:22
that as long as cuz it's the 3M but I
9:25
said but as long as it's the same color
9:28
as long as it's white cuz I wanted it to
9:30
be a detail and not like an overbearing
9:35
thing because that's how Tinker saw it
9:37
got it right these are special because I
9:39
think they only made three pair of them
9:42
one for them to keep one for me to rock
9:45
and then one for me to stock so this is
9:46
the stock one and and the difference is
9:48
you get the date in the Super Bowl that
9:52
they were at and then they drop under 5
9:54
minutes they sell out what was it like
9:56
to see it s I mean you you were busy
9:58
obviously but
10:00
no Reggie Reggie from from Jordan hits
10:03
me and said the sneaker sold out and I
10:06
was like what he goes they sold out in 5
10:08
minutes I was like wait I was on stage
10:09
for 12 here we go you know what I mean
10:12
so like the sneakers sold out quicker
10:15
then I could actually get back off the
10:17
stage and so yeah it was it was an it
10:19
was a cool moment and and even at that
10:21
time you know we were working on the man
10:25
of the woods kind of I call the Boot
10:27
three that's what I call it
10:29
right right yeah that so so it was funny
10:32
because two or three days before I
10:36
performed at the Superbowl I had a
10:38
meeting with with Mike a conference
10:41
meeting what was that like uh it was
10:42
great you know he said he really loved
10:44
what we were going for it cuz my my
10:46
thing with the man of the wood shoe was
10:48
I wanted it to feel like a boot I wanted
10:50
it to feel like that n little like a
10:52
winter Bo you know and um I was always
10:56
into the wallabies okay you know like I
10:59
was I was like how do we do like a
11:01
reference to the WABE so that's why we
11:04
did the leather laces okay you know and
11:06
obviously it came with the orange pop
11:08
that you could do as well but I just
11:10
wanted to have that sort of like boot
11:12
feel to it and the body of the of the
11:15
shoe lends itself to that anyway yeah
11:18
but these are called the these are
11:19
called the higher hes which is a song
11:21
off that album and you know had a ET in
11:24
there and then you know on the inside
11:27
it's one Sho says is cruel and then the
11:30
other one says Fame is a lie love that
11:33
and also I want to talk about one night
11:35
in Beverly
11:36
Hills uh Barney okay that relates to
11:40
this a little bit okay is this a
11:43
reference yes yes
11:46
wow this is a reference and I see it and
11:49
I love it because it when you think of
11:52
like what goes into these designs you
11:54
think of mood boards and stuff like this
11:55
but a Sakai jacket at Barney's in
11:58
Beverly I had found this Sakai amazing
12:02
you know winter coat and I just love the
12:04
colors of it and I was like this feels
12:06
like the color palette to my my album
12:10
yeah and so yeah that was the coat that
12:12
inspired the shoe and I love it cuz
12:15
there's a little yellow on the hood and
12:16
there's even yellow in the eyelids yep
12:18
love that there's the there's orange
12:20
detail yellow yeah you got it man love
12:23
that going back just for a second to the
12:25
Super Bowl ones though you said you have
12:27
one to the the ones with the date one to
12:29
stock one for them one to rock but you
12:33
were locked in but the C wait it's such
12:36
a sneaker head thing but I know I know
12:40
the that's why that's why I brought
12:42
those actually I thought maybe those but
12:44
those aren't the on right cuz no those
12:46
have zero creases okay the big I brought
12:49
that one big sneaker head thing but
12:50
listen you got the Super Bowl
12:52
performance that was a big conundrum for
12:55
me because I was like do I break these
12:57
in you know what I mean cuz I'm like am
12:59
I going to come off limping you know
13:02
what I mean or like am I going to have
13:03
like the worst Tow Jam ever you went for
13:05
function I went well but only because I
13:09
had two hair okay you know what I mean
13:11
it's crazy cuz oh yeah you'll take an
13:14
Instagram photo and you're not like
13:16
tying your shoe all the comments are wow
13:19
the crease the crease the crease but
13:21
that's a major I feel like I do have to
13:23
defend myself right now there go there
13:26
was one for work and then there was one
13:29
that I was going to keep and uh another
13:32
thing yeah that was yeah that was funny
13:34
aggressive priest but you had another
13:36
one on Deck Tinker half field this five
13:40
this we you know it's good that we're
13:41
ending here in this section cuz you said
13:43
that this was the first one the kid
13:45
cutting the grass you think this was one
13:46
of the first ones okay the first pair of
13:49
Jordans that I ever had I didn't buy
13:52
them they were they were given to me
13:54
okay and they were the fives with the
13:56
number on the heel okay this shoe there
13:58
was a girl that lived in The Cove of the
14:02
street that I lived in and she was like
14:04
2 years older than me I was in sixth
14:06
grade she was in eighth grade and she
14:10
was the captain of our basketball team
14:12
at our school and could who like wow for
14:15
real and I had the biggest crush on her
14:18
especially when I found out she had a
14:20
pair of Jordans she wore these Jordans
14:22
to play and so she literally gave me the
14:27
Sho what a story
14:29
off her feet that was the beginning of
14:31
story me collecting Jordans you had a
14:34
crush on her did you get the girl no
14:36
just the shoes the shoes okay okay I'm
14:40

15:35
Miramichi uh which means a place of
15:38
