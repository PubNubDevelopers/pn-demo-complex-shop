00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's up everybody? It's Joe from Complex. We're in LA at Flight Club with the Grammy and Emmy award-winning Justin Timberlake.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Going to do some sneaker shopping tonight, see what he's feeling, and hopefully buy some sneakers.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Before we get to Jordan the shoes, I want to talk about Jordan the person. What was it like looking up to him?

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Gosh yeah, I had posters of MJ on my walls growing up in Tennessee.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I started cutting grass on my street... 10 bucks a lawn... trying to save up to go wait in line at Foot Locker.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll never forget when the black and Olive 9s came out. We all wanted those. Such an underrated pair.

7
00:03:12,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's ironic that the two sneakers that had the most effect on me were the Jordan 3s and Air Max. Same guy, Tinker Hatfield.

8
00:04:24,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Where did I wear the Indiglo 14s? The 'Bye Bye Bye' video. The whole crew matched.

9
00:06:13,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We want to talk Legends Of Summer. We did an all red one... the color of the shoe is the exact same color of the stage Jay and I built.

10
00:08:33,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We got to talk the Super Bowl moment. This pair is really special because it has the Nike Swoosh... Tinker's original sketch.

11
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Reggie from Jordan hits me and said the sneaker sold out in 5 minutes. I was like, wait, I was on stage for 12!

12
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My thing with the 'Man of the Woods' shoe was I wanted it to feel like a boot.

13
00:11:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I had found this Sacai winter coat at Barney's... that coat inspired the shoe's color palette.

14
00:13:40,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The first pair of Jordans I ever had... there was a girl... she was the captain of our basketball team... she literally gave me the shoes off her feet.

15
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So how can I help you out today? I'm definitely going to get some stuff for me, but let's start with the kids first.

16
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay, now to me. I got to do the Born and Raised. Oh, big dogs. Got to do those.

17
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think it's time to go to the big boy section. Let's do it.

18
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You got the Red October? I do have the Octobers... All right, I'll take 'em.

19
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Did I buy that many? I think so.

20
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So your total tonight, we're looking at $22,014. Do I need to take out a loan?

21
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You are all set my guy. Thank you so much. I got more than what I needed!
