around Olive nines maybe yeah yeah yeah

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
when they came out like we all wanted

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
those so good such an underrated pair

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
underrated pair well and also growing up

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
in a rural area it was a sneaker you

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
could wear and not feel so bad if it got

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
well it kind of looks like a Timberland

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that's

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
yeah totally which when they winterized

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that shoe I was like what took them so

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
long who who just thought of this right

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
before we're going to talk a lot of

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Jordans but I really like early 2000s

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
cuz you were Weare ing kind of like Cool

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Air Maxes you were really in like your

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Air Max bag air max 98 oh yeah what

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
about like that Air Max era what do you

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
remember about that well it's kind of

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ironic that the two sneakers that had

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the most effect on me when I first saw

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
them were the threes okay and Air Max

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
yeah and same

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
find out that the same guy yes was

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
behind was the genius behind yeah your

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
boy now yeah well yeah yeah I have a

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
story yeah but yeah I went through a big

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Air Max phase just because like super

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
comfortable shoe yeah um I have big

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
arches in my feet okay so I would wear

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
them on stage when I could because they

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
were they just supported my feet and

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
when they used to you know when they

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
first sold them they came with the

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
little the little wedge yep I remember

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
all this the arch W it was a styrofoam

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it was blue and pink like that

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to really save the arch you just threw

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
them out you threw them out with like

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the gel that you can't eat the little

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
things that are pois I I I would spend

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so much time trying to put them the

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
right way in the yeah so another moment

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
okay we want to talk Legends Of Summer

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't Throw yeah well I'm going to catch

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you could throw Legends Of Summer these

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
are two yes yeah so this wrapped up yeah

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
one two three yeah yeah so we did we did

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
an all red one

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
this I don't even know how to describe

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it we called them the Dorothy they look

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
like the the red slippers you know it

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
literally like somebody littered them

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you know what I mean and um and yeah I

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
really wanted I mean the three has

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
always been one of my favorite shoes and

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the two to me has always been the most

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
underrated that's what a lot of people

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
say of Jordans that's just my personal

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
opinion and so the color of this shoe is

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
actually the uh exact same color of the

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
stage Jay and I have put together for of

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the summer so when I

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
stage it actually like almost

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
camouflaged itself makes sense and um if

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you kind of look down on the bottom it's

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
got a reference to suit and Thai which

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
which was a song at that time suit and

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Tai and holy grail and yeah I wanted all

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
different materials on all the pieces of

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
architecture of the shoe so and the

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
shoes you know we couldn't even Source

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
them you had to bring them you had to

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
bring them well yeah as you I said you

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
have them our friend mayor who had the

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
ones he hooked up the the two-color one

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
but you bought them from home because

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
these stores

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
sneaker doesn't even have them but you

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
also said you don't even have that many

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
pairs they're going for like $20,000

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what happened to all your pairs I know

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
[Music]

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
yeah all good Joe I'm good you're living

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
on the

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
don't think I ever dropped one wow I'm

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
going to drop the next one you just

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that's like he hasn't miss a free throw

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
all night yeah CL

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
exactly we got to talk the Super Bowl

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
moment okay you debut these and this

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
pair is really special this is cuz these

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
right are but little different in the

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
details you if you notice these you get

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the you get the Nike yes and this was

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you know obviously if you know you know

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it's you know if you know you know this

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
was the original design for the three

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and that Tinker you know said you know

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the jump

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
on its own and we should take the Nike

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Swoosh off which I'm sure was very

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
controversial right conversation at the

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
time I I would not want to be in that

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
board meeting exactly but so we talked

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
about like what if we brought the

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
original design back for the Super Bowl

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
performance and I I said I'm good with

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that as long as cuz it's the 3M but I

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
said but as long as it's the same color

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
as long as it's white cuz I wanted it to

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
be a detail and not like an overbearing

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
thing because that's how Tinker saw it

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
got it right

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
think they only made three pair of them

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
one for them to keep one for me to rock

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and then one for me to stock so this is

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the stock one and and the difference is

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you get the date in the Super Bowl that

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
they were at and then they drop under 5

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
minutes they sell out what was it like

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to see it s I mean you you were busy

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
obviously but

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
no Reggie Reggie from from Jordan hits

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
me and said the sneaker sold out and I

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
was like what he goes they sold out in 5

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
minutes I was like wait I was on

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
stage

231
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
so like the sneakers sold out quicker

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
then I could actually get back off the

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
stage and so yeah it was it was an it

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
was a cool moment and and even at that

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
time you know we were working on the man

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of the woods kind of I call the Boot

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
three that's what I call it

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
right right yeah that so so it was funny

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because two or three days before I

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
performed at the Superbowl I had a

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
meeting with with Mike a conference

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
meeting what was that like uh it was

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
great you know he said he really loved

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
thing with the man of the wood shoe was

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I wanted it to feel like a boot I wanted

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it to feel like that n little like a

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
winter Bo you know and um I was always

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
into the wallabies okay you know like I

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
was I was like how do we do like a

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
reference to the WABE so that's why we

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
did the leather laces okay you know and

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
obviously it came with the orange pop

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that you could do as well but I just

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
wanted to have that sort of like boot

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
feel to it and the body of the of

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
shoe lends itself to that anyway yeah

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but these are called the these are

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
called the higher hes which is a song

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
off that album and you know had a ET in

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
there and then you know on the inside

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's one Sho says is cruel and then the

263
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
other one says Fame is a lie love that

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and also I want to talk about one night

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in Beverly

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hills uh Barney okay that relates to

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
this a little bit okay is this a

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
reference yes yes

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
wow this is a reference and I see it and

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I love it because it when you think of

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
like what goes into these designs you

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
think of

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
but a Sakai jacket at Barney's in

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Beverly I had found this Sakai amazing

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you know winter coat and I just love the

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
colors of it and I was like this feels

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
like the color palette to my my album

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
yeah and so yeah that was the coat that

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
inspired the shoe and I love it cuz

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there's a little yellow on the hood and

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
there's even yellow in the eyelids yep

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
love that there's the there's orange

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
detail yellow yeah you got it man love

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
that going back just for a second to the

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Super Bowl ones though you said you have

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
one to the the ones

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
stock one for them one to rock but you

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
were locked in but the C wait it's such

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
a sneaker head thing but I know I know

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the that's why that's why I brought

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
those actually I thought maybe those but

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
those aren't the on right cuz no those

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
have zero creases okay the big I brought

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that one big sneaker head thing but

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
listen you got the Super Bowl

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
performance that was a big conundrum for

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
me because I was like do I break these

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
like the worst Tow Jam ever you went for

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
function I went well but only because I

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
had two hair okay you know what I mean

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000

the crease the crease the crease but

308
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that's a major I feel like I do have to

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
defend myself right now there go there

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
was one for work and then there was one

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
that I was going to keep and uh another

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
thing yeah that was yeah that was funny

313
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
aggressive priest but you had another

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
one on Deck Tinker half

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
that this was the first one the kid

318
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
cutting the grass you think this was one

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
of the first ones okay the first pair of

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Jordans that I ever had I didn't buy

321
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
them they were they were given to me

322
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
okay and they were the fives with the

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
number on the heel okay this shoe there

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
was a girl that lived in The Cove of the

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
street that I lived in and she was like

326
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
2 years older than me I was in sixth

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
grade she was in eighth grade and she

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
was the

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
at our school and could who like wow for

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
real and I had the biggest crush on her

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
especially when I found out she had a

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
pair of Jordans she wore these Jordans

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to play and so she literally gave me the

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Sho what a story

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
off her feet that was the beginning of

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
story me collecting Jordans you had a

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
crush on her did you get the girl no

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
just the shoes the shoes okay okay I'm

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
doing all

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
right exactly last thing I want to talk

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
about another special project I think

342
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
very close to your heart Big Creek Golf

343
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Club oh yes the first golf outing that

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
you got a special makeup three pairs for

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
a tournament and now that golf Club

347
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
doesn't exist anymore no no it's it's a

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
completely different well so my my

349
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
history with that golf club was public

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
course and my stepdad really loved Golf

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and he kind of like birthed my my love

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
for I I was I was very like I was very

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
clear with him that I was like no I'm a

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hooper I don't play golf and so big

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Creek Golf Club it was funny like as I

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
got older I found out that they were

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
going to shut the place down and kind

358
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
of

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Condominiums and so we actually went in

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and saved the golf club we bought it

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
okay and we turned it into

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Miramichi uh which means a place of

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
happy Retreat all right right now I

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
ended up selling it since then because I

365
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
