00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,165
Hello everyone and welcome back

2
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,005
to another live stream.

3
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,845
Today we're gonna be diving deep into some old school retro

4
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:33,045
gaming with four iconic Nintendo handhelds,

5
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,845
a Maroon Nintendo Game Boy color,

6
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,605
a Red Game Boy Advance sp a White Nintendo, DSI

7
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,485
and a Nintendo three DS xl.

8
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,245
Each handheld has its own conditions, its own story.

9
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:44,685
So if you'd like to learn more

10
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,565
and check out to see if these consoles look interesting

11
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,325
to you, be sure to stick around and keep watching.

12
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:49,605
Let's go ahead and get started then.

13
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:53,465
So to get started, we're going to be talking about first

14
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,865
a Nintendo game Boy color.

15
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,425
So this Maroon Game Boy color was first released in Japan on

16
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,225
October 21st, 1998,

17
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:04,265
and then shortly afterwards in North America in November

18
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,065
of 1998, that same year.

19
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:09,505
This maroon edition definitely is an excellent condition

20
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,465
and also helps symbolize

21
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,345
and pop out some of the other colors on the console.

22
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:15,745
So talking about the console itself,

23
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,185
the shape it's in is in excellent shape.

24
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:20,065
However, there is a light scratch.

25
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,665
I think you can kind of see it on the camera right there on

26
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,945
the screen, as well

27
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,865
as then the barcode on the back is also not in the best

28
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:28,825
of shape, but can be easily replaced.

29
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:32,465
Tech-wise, it's powered by an eight bit Z 80 processor,

30
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,145
32 kilobytes of Ram.

31
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,665
Woo. You gotta be careful with that.

32
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:39,825
And features a vibrant one 60 by 1 44 pixel screen capable

33
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,225
of displaying up to 56 colors simultaneously,

34
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,425
which was very excellent tech for back at its day.

35
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:48,345
Uh, and also an interesting fact the game color was the

36
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,945
first Nintendo console to support backward compatibility.

37
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:56,095
Eh, eh, uh, the joke is that it's the first sequel

38
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,095
to its handheld consoles.

39
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:59,055
So, uh, dumb jokes aside, let's go ahead

40
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,575
and pop in the batteries to turn on the console.

41
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,895
And, oh, I forgot to mention,

42
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,415
the Battery Bay itself is in excellent shape

43
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:09,295
with no corrosion and no, uh, rust, as you can see.

44
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:11,775
Let's go ahead and put in some batteries.

45
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:13,455
And while I'm doing this, I'll go ahead

46
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:14,975
and answer a question.

47
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,135
Does the volume wheel work? Yes, yes, it does.

48
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,575
Let me go ahead and make sure that

49
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,175
that is working and test it for you.

50
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:23,315
Any other questions as well?

51
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,795
Does it come with a backlit screen? No.

52
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,395
So this is everything is stock in this

53
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:28,435
Nintendo game Boy color.

54
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,355
Um, there are no modifications done.

55
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:31,955
So yes, there are mods

56
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,755
and kits where you can actually replace the screen

57
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,315
with A LCD

58
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:38,835
or even like an LED screen, um, that will also fit natively

59
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:39,875
inside the Game Boy color.

60
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:41,875
And you can also replace the case as well

61
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,435
with your own case if you would like.

62
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,675
So essentially just taking out the internals.

63
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,515
Um, however, the shape of this case

64
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,715
is an excellent condition.

65
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:50,635
It's all stock, all the labels are even stock,

66
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,395
and it's kind of the little bit of the yellow wing

67
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,235
and kind of a little bit of the bumpy feeling

68
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,875
of the barcode, but, um, that can all be replaced easily.

69
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,075
So let's go ahead and get started.

70
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:01,015
So, initial conditions,

71
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,275
so the Game Boy screen does come on.

72
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,235
Um, I don't, let me make sure you can hear the sound.

73
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,395
Um, actually to do that, let's just pop in a copy

74
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,595
of Game Boy of Pokemon Crystal version.

75
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,755
And this is an, an American Nintendo game boy color.

76
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:18,715
So all the Game Boy colors are able

77
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,595
to play any kind of game from any region.

78
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:23,595
So the Nintendo Game Boy color is a region free console.

79
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:26,595
However, just keep in mind that, um, you know,

80
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,795
language barriers of course are going to be a thing.

81
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,075
So let's go ahead and turn this on with the copy of Game Boy

82
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:33,115
of, uh, Pokemon Crystal inside the game.

83
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,455
Lemme make sure you can hear the sound as well.

84
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,735
So I just saw a question about the volume.

85
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:46,925
Yeah, hopefully you can hear the sound.

86
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,935
Excellent. Okay. So as you can see, uh,

87
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:55,255
it's running a basically original copy

88
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:56,615
of Game Boy or of Pokemon Crystal.

89
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,535
Uh, of course it looks like the battery has run dry.

90
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:02,055
It was recently replaced, so I need to

91
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,215
start a new game save file.

92
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:07,015
So just to make sure that all the buttons are working

93
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,295
correctly, let's go ahead

94
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,175
and skip past, uh, professor Oak's dialogue.

95
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,255
I believe it's Professor Oak.

96
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,535
I don't think Elm comes in until later on in the game.

97
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,615
Uh, we're setting the clock. Yep, of course.

98
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,255
It's 10:00 AM actually, it is almost 10:00 AM So

99
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:20,955
while this is going on, I'll just read

100
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,035
another question in the chat.

101
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,725
Um, does Pokemon Crystal come with the game?

102
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,245
No, it does not. I apologize.

103
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,445
No, it, uh, it just, just to kind of show off

104
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:29,525
that the game is working and testing,

105
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,125
I have a few Pokemon games to kind of test out with,

106
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,365
but, uh, the games are not for sale, it's just

107
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:36,165
for the consoles themselves.

108
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,585
So as you can see, uh, the game is working perfectly fine.

109
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:42,185
Um, everything is working as intended.

110
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,925
So as we've kind of talked about, um, the,

111
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:48,445
the console condition, all the buttons are working properly.

112
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,325
Uh, the D pad's working select and starts.

113
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,965
It feels responsive. It doesn't feel

114
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:54,125
sticky, it doesn't feel stuck.

115
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:55,645
So it's a very good

116
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:59,525
and overall excellent condition console is the light.

117
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:00,885
Oh, the light is a little too bright. Okay.

118
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,405
Yeah, let me go ahead and turn off the light for now

119
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:04,885
so it's not as glaring on the screen.

120
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,675
Yeah, so that, that actually looks pretty,

121
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,875
pretty in excellent shape.

122
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:19,925
Excellent. Okay. So I'm not seeing any more questions,

123
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,085
just a lot of, uh, interested folks in it.

124
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,605
Okay, that's awesome. Glad to hear.

125
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,005
And you know, of course the, it's gonna slowly fade away.

126
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,525
So that is the Nintendo game boy color.

127
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:30,245
Okay, next, let's go ahead

128
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,245
and go up a generation, well,

129
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,645
I guess technically two generations

130
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:37,485
and talk about the next item, a Red Nintendo game.

131
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:40,725
Boy, advance. Sp So this one is not in as good

132
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,805
of a shape, unfortunately.

133
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:45,445
Um, it is however, a pretty big leap in terms of technology.

134
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:48,765
Uh, first we have the backlit screen where you can adjust it

135
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,645
by pressing the mi this kind of middle top button

136
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:51,925
to adjust the backlit screen.

137
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,085
Speaking of the screen, the condition is not that great,

138
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,650
unfortunately, so there's a lot of kind of, of scratches.

139
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,165
Uh, there's even like some kind

140
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,605
of a missing film on the screen right there, as you can see.

141
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,645
Um, and even kind of the siding,

142
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:04,805
there's like a bunch of wear.

143
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,285
So this would definitely need, if you would like

144
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,965
to play this natively, uh, a new case as well

145
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,805
as a new screen to talk about.

146
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,565
Buttons themselves, though, they feel great shape.

147
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,925
So the buttons are responsive, they don't stick, um,

148
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,805
it's just the shell and the screen are not in the best

149
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,805
of shape as you can kind of see all these scratches

150
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:26,395
on the top right there, as well as even the back, like some

151
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:29,035
of the labels where the Game Boy label is all faded

152
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,995
and a lot of the text is missing and some wear

153
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,555
and tear in the cartridge port.

154
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,675
But the cartridge port itself also looks in fantastic shape.

155
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,995
The shoulder buttons are in great shape, as well

156
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,435
as the different ports to be able

157
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:42,955
to plug in your light Game Boy Printer, the connection cable

158
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,915
or the serial port for the Game Boy

159
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,515
printer, if you would like to do so.

160
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,045
So the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.

161
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:51,805
Sp uh, if we talk about kind of the, while I'm prepping,

162
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:55,605
the game itself originally came out in, excuse me,

163
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,245
February 14th, 2003 in Japan

164
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,725
and in North America that next month in 2003.

165
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:03,245
And not only was it an excellent ergonomic shape

166
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,965
because you could fold the screen and things like that,

167
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,725
but it was able to then upgrade

168
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,365
with Game Boy Advanced SP Cart

169
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,605
or Game Boy Advanced Cartridges,

170
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,445
which just the color popped a lot more.

171
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,805
You didn't have to worry about batteries any longer

172
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,125
because it's all an internal battery.

173
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,445
And by the way, the internal battery's in great shape.

174
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,805
It's not bulging as you can kind of see on the camera.

175
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,245
It's just flat, completely.

176
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,245
Um, and this is all stock as well

177
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,565
as you can probably tell by the wear and tear.

178
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,005
So let's go ahead and pop in a copy of Pokemon Ruby, uh,

179
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,165
Ruby version while we test this out.

180
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,765
And lemme go ahead and look at the chat,

181
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,845
see if there's any questions.

182
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:35,845
Does Ruby version come with it?

183
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:36,925
No, it does not, unfortunately.

184
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,885
Um, has there been any modifications made? No.

185
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,045
And is there any accessories that come with the system? No.

186
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,205
So this is just the system itself.

187
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,405
Of course it will come with a charger.

188
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:49,685
I believe the chargers the same for the sp as well as it is

189
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,085
with the Nintendo ds.

190
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,525
However, uh, the Ds that is going to be showing is going

191
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,205
to be the DSI, so I'm not a hundred percent certain if

192
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,405
those two are compatible.

193
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,285
Uh, no, it would appear not based on the charging

194
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,725
ports themselves.

195
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,005
So if you have the original, uh, Nintendo DS

196
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:09,685
where it has this kind of, uh, thicker kind of a power port,

197
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,605
then yes, you'd be able to do that as well.

198
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:16,205
So let's go ahead and pop, turn this on just

199
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,045
to make sure you can hear sound

200
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:21,535
okay

201
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,125
now, if the camera would focus a little bit, please focus.

202
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,405
There we go. So the internal clock has run out on this game.

203
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:36,405
This, this one needs to be replaced for the battery.

204
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,325
Um, however, uh, the safe file is still there, so

205
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:43,155
luckily that's cool.

206
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,195
However, even though the game is not for sale, the sale,

207
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,835
the safe file is still existing.

208
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,515
So the Game Boy advanced SP cartridges for,

209
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,235
or Game Boy Advanced cartridges, were a little bit better

210
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,395
and handling that compared to the Game Boy Color cartridges.

211
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,205
So as you can see, uh, everything is working on the system.

212
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,725
The A button works, B button works, um, select

213
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:01,525
and start get out of this menu

214
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:05,435
and then select, we can't use the registered device.

215
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:08,235
It's probably the bicycle and the dpad all work as well

216
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:10,555
as the backlit screen.

217
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,915
So everything is working on the system, uh,

218
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,035
like I just had mentioned before.

219
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,235
Oh, I see a question about audio. Yes, of course.

220
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,555
Let me, lemme test the audio for you.

221
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,355
Hopefully you can hear it. Yeah. Okay.

222
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,415
I'm hearing people can hear it. Yeah. Okay.

223
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,415
I could adjust it. Yep, I just saw a question about that.

224
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:33,795
That's completely quiet. And this is Max volume. Yeah. Okay.

225
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:36,645
So yeah, people are able to hear it. Fantastic.

226
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,535
So in terms of, uh, text specs

227
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:42,575
for the Game Boy Advance sp while I'm just kind of waiting

228
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:47,015
for some more questions, we've got the 32 bit arm 70 TMI

229
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,815
processor as well as a s has a more impressive graphics.

230
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,255
And so, uh, graphics card basically allowing

231
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:56,655
for smoother gameplay as well as a, like I had mentioned

232
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:59,735
before, the front lit, uh, the built-in front lit, uh,

233
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:02,935
screen, as well as adjustable brightness.

234
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:07,655
And of course, um, it's able to play essentially any type

235
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,255
of Game Boy advanced game from any region

236
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,335
because up until the Nintendo DS all Nintendo consoles

237
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:13,375
were region free.

238
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,935
And we'll get into that a little bit more with the DSI.

239
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,175
So I, I am seeing a question.

240
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:21,055
Does this game, does this work with Game Boy games? Yes.

241
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,615
So the Game Boy Advance SP is fully compatible all the way

242
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,135
back to the original Game Boy.

243
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:26,495
Um, and the Game Boy color,

244
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,095
we gotta bring this back in as well.

245
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,815
Uh, the Game Boy Color also works

246
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,895
with original Game Boy games and Game Boy Color Games.

247
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,295
The Game Boy Advance SP works with Game Boy Game Boy,

248
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,695
color Game Boy Pocket,

249
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,175
which I don't believe there was a difference

250
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,015
between the games and Game Boy Advance Games.

251
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,295
I'm not seeing any more questions about the sp

252
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,135
so I will just go ahead and shut this off

253
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,635
and we'll move on to the next console.

254
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,755
Excellent. Okay, so, uh, for the next console it is going

255
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,795
to be the Nintendo DSI.

256
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,675
So this is the Japanese cop,

257
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,675
or excuse me, the Japanese copy,

258
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,355
which was released on November 1st, 2008 in Japan

259
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:08,155
and in North America and April 5th, 2009,

260
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:09,355
so about a year later.

261
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:13,115
So it was definitely the same family as a Nintendo ds.

262
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,995
However, uh, keep in mind this is the DSI

263
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:20,555
and it is a Japanese copy of a Nintendo handheld console.

264
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:22,195
And what does that mean?

265
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:26,475
Well, that means that you cannot play, unfortunately, um,

266
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,435
American Games for the Nintendo DSI.

267
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,755
So there are some differences

268
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:33,595
between the DSI games versus the DS games.

269
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:36,355
So Nintendo DS games, you can play on any system

270
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,315
across any region, the Nintendo DSI,

271
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,555
which is a huge distinction.

272
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,475
So if you're planning on buying this to play your DS games,

273
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:45,835
make sure you're aware that the can only play the Japanese

274
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:47,195
copies and vice versa.

275
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:51,115
So the American dsis can only play the nten,

276
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,825
the American Games, not the, the other region bound games.

277
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:56,785
So important distinction,

278
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,345
but, uh, we can talk about

279
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,905
that a little bit more later if there are any questions.

280
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,065
And you can also be sure to look it up on the Wiki

281
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:05,025
for any other few more questions.

282
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,145
So the cool thing about the DSI is

283
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,985
that it was first released with, uh, dual cameras.

284
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:11,945
So as you can kinda see the front facing camera

285
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:15,185
and then the back camera right here, um,

286
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,785
it also f featured the first DSI shop, which, you know,

287
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:19,945
the E shop's huge thing.

288
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,505
Nintendo Switch Shop, uh, a big deal for digital games

289
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,585
as well as being powered by dual arm processors

290
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,465
and features a dual 2 56 by 1 92 pixel screen,

291
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,305
so it's even bigger and better than the

292
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:31,825
original Game Boy color screens.

293
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:35,145
Um, so the cool thing is, uh,

294
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,265
it is a fully Nintendo DS system

295
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,625
or maybe not cool depending.

296
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,385
Um, so it can only play Nintendo DS cartridges,

297
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:44,105
however, it cannot play Nintendo GBA.

298
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:48,005
So if I have a fact, I do have one.

299
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,485
So I have an original Nintendo DS console here.

300
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:54,165
So as you can see, it can play the DS games as well

301
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,485
as the GBA games.

302
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,245
And also I had mentioned before about the sp it has the same

303
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,245
charging port as the Gable Advance sp

304
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:05,075
however, the DSI has a way nicer screen in terms

305
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,595
of quality between the two systems

306
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,075
and then, um, can only play the DS games

307
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,075
so it can play both DS and DSI games.

308
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:13,635
Uh, you don't have to worry about that,

309
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:17,395
it just cannot go past a previous generation of the console.

310
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:20,515
So let's go ahead and turn this on

311
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,235
and looking at the quality of the system itself.

312
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,835
So this is probably one of the nicest shaped consoles

313
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,235
that I have available today.

314
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,235
Uh, the game boy color was probably in second place.

315
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:31,315
This one is in pretty much pristine condition,

316
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,355
so I'll be sure to include a stylus, don't worry.

317
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:36,505
But the game card slot is fine.

318
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:38,105
Um, there's no problems there.

319
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,905
The door is not wonky

320
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:41,465
or anything like that internal battery,

321
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:44,875
and it is flat as you can kind of see, so you don't have

322
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,995
to worry about any bubbling

323
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:50,155
for the internal battery going bad as well as a headphone

324
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:55,035
and port 3.5 millimeter jack, as well as the game card slot.

325
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,035
Excuse me, I I had said this was the game card slot.

326
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:58,435
I meant this was the SD card slot,

327
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,635
which does include an SD card,

328
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:00,835
so you're not gonna have to worry about that.

329
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,075
And the game card slot is in great shape as well.

330
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,795
So the shoulder buttons are also working as well.

331
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:08,155
The hinge is tight

332
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:11,625
and responsive, probably hear the clicking.

333
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,665
Um, and then we'll go ahead and turn the console on itself.

334
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:20,245
I'll wait for any questions. Oh, the screen?

335
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:21,885
Yeah, you wanna, yeah, you okay?

336
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,285
You wanna see the screen operational? Yeah, apologize.

337
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,445
I always really love talking about the DS consoles, so, um,

338
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,325
as you can see, it is in Japanese, so please keep

339
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,365
that in mind as you are playing the games.

340
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:33,805
So you're able to play DS of region free games

341
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,045
as I'm seeing some questions about

342
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,245
the which games you can play.

343
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,125
Yes, you can play in the Nintendo ds, uh,

344
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,165
games from any region inside this game.

345
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,645
For DSI, it can only be based on the region

346
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,205
that the console is from.

347
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:49,065
So meaning we will show with a tester is Pokemon

348
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,445
White from Japan.

349
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,525
So this is a DSI specific game.

350
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:56,525
It cannot be played on American systems.

351
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:00,525
However, Pokemon like Platinum, Pokemon Pearl

352
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:03,405
and Diamond, which are Nintendo DS games can be played

353
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:05,685
that are American or English based,

354
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,565
can be played on a Japanese system.

355
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,125
So a little bit of confusion there,

356
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,045
but Nintendo stopped kind

357
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,205
of doing the whole region free systems, uh, past this point.

358
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:17,245
So the three Ds will be the exact same issue.

359
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,845
Uh, just maybe a little more clear

360
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,125
because it's only three DS games.

361
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,845
So let's go ahead and pop in a copy

362
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,405
of Pokemon White for the Japanese version.

363
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:29,775
Just go ahead and pop that in there. And as you can see,

364
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,035
the menu is responsive

365
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:36,985
and I'll make sure to turn up the volume,

366
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:39,865
which is just some buttons and it's working.

367
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,875
Great. And while

368
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,395
that's booting up, I'll wait for any questions.

369
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:45,075
It's come with any games. No,

370
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,915
unfortunately all the consoles do not come with games.

371
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,685
Does it come with any accessories? No, it does not a case.

372
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,125
No, it won't come with a case,

373
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,245
however, it will come with a

374
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,405
charger, so you don't have to worry about that.

375
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,325
Um, so the system is quite loud,

376
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:02,925
so I don't think you're gonna have to

377
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,925
worry about anything like that.

378
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,205
So lemme go ahead and turn that down.

379
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,805
Um, but as you can see, the screens are crystal

380
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:09,085
clear in terms of quality.

381
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,845
I mean it's, it's huge and above

382
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,685
and beyond what some of the other screens were like.

383
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,845
So this is just, uh, a different save file.

384
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:16,285
It's asking me to turn in the cge.

385
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,045
I, I know this because I've played the

386
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,645
American version quite a few times.

387
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,405
So lemme just go ahead and just press B on that.

388
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:23,925
Uh, okay, maybe I'll just have

389
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,285
to say yes or oh, that's right.

390
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,525
There's, uh, two different dialogues.

391
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,285
Lemme go ahead and wait. Uh,

392
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:29,845
any defects or problems with the screen?

393
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,605
No, I mean there, there is some like, like a little bit

394
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:35,485
of wear of course like on like the, the dpad

395
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:37,645
and as well as the buttons when you're pressing down.

396
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,445
Um, of course the screen, I'll be sure

397
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:40,605
to clean the sc the screens

398
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:43,125
before I even, uh, send it off or anything like that.

399
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:46,165
So no worries about that. Uh, can you test the cameras?

400
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,605
Yes, of course I can test the cameras.

401
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:49,445
Let me go ahead and show that the game itself is working.

402
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,885
So the dpad, no problem. And open up the menu.

403
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,585
We can be sure to press the B button, anything like that.

404
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:02,165
And we can also be sure to open up anything like that.

405
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,965
Start select, all those things are working fine.

406
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,725
So someone had asked if I can show off the cameras.

407
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:11,485
Yes, of course. Lemme go ahead and shut off the system

408
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,395
while it's booting up.

409
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,875
I'll wait to see if there's any other questions.

410
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,155
It seems like, seems like people are just talking about the

411
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:25,515
region, region bound.

412
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:28,235
Yep. So, okay, let's go ahead and take a look at the camera.

413
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:29,515
So I'm assuming it's this app.

414
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,755
Um, I don't speak Japanese or I can read

415
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:32,995
or even write in Japanese.

416
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,915
Um, so, or I could speak just the very bare minimum.

417
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,835
Um, but I'm definitely not fluent.

418
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:41,395
Um, so the problem is I believe it would require an SD card.

419
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:42,635
So I don't have one offhand.

420
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:45,635
However, uh, I did test the cameras when I first purchased

421
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,035
this system while I was in Japan.

422
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:49,485
And yes, the cameras are working properly

423
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,965
and I can show you the cameras on the three DS xl.

424
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,205
That's will be next because

425
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,165
I actually have an SD card in there.

426
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:00,655
Okay, which is kind

427
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:04,095
of a segue now into the next console is the Nintendo

428
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,375
three DS xl.

429
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:09,445
So this console is Nintendo's last.

430
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,365
Well, I don't know if you wanna consider the switch

431
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,765
to be handheld, but, uh, it is kind of Nintendo's last bit

432
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:16,925
of a hurrah in terms of a camera.

433
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,325
So please don't mind the glare. This is my microphone.

434
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,365
So as you can kind of see the, the, the microphone itself.

435
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,645
So, uh, the three S XL was released in Japan

436
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,805
and North America on July 28th, 2012.

437
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:31,205
So it features a dual core arm 11 processor, 120 megabytes

438
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,965
of ram, and a much more powerful GPU and larger screen.

439
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:39,915
So I believe I have, yes, so this is not for sale,

440
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,115
but I have the original three Ds as well.

441
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,555
And look at that screen comparison difference,

442
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:47,475
it's huge compared between the two.

443
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:51,035
Um, I mean, for me, I have, I don't have very large hands,

444
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:52,355
but even for me, the, the,

445
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,475
the original three DS was just, it was too small in my hands.

446
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,115
Yeah, I'm, I'm seeing some comments about people saying

447
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,795
like, you know, looking at the, the screen difference

448
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,835
between the two and I, once I started playing again,

449
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:03,235
I had this firm when I was traveling, um, just

450
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,075
because I was going to some kinda, some tough areas.

451
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,675
And this one is just so much nicer to play.

452
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:08,915
Once I got this, I upgraded

453
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,395
and I just, I just put this on a shelf

454
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:11,395
and haven't looked back just

455
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,355
because it's just so much bigger, so much nicer.

456
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,315
The buttons are so much larger, um,

457
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:16,595
and the screen is much more vibrant.

458
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,175
Uh, no, no, the, the original three Ds is not for sale,

459
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,495
but I saw some interest for

460
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,655
that, but no, that, that's all right.

461
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:27,695
Yeah, yeah. So yes, so, um, uh,

462
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:30,415
the cool thing is this is the first 3D based console in

463
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:31,815
terms of availability.

464
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,015
Um, personally I never used it a lot,

465
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,615
however, I can show you that it is working, I hope.

466
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,615
Uh, some of the Pokemon games are not 3D really enabled.

467
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,495
I don't have a copy of X and Y with me.

468
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,815
Um, and we can kinda show off the game in a little bit,

469
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,975
but I wanna show off the condition of the console, uh, just

470
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,975
because, uh, a reminder, again, this is a Japanese copy

471
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:51,775
of the Nintendo three DS extra large.

472
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,495
They called it the LL in Japan,

473
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:55,375
but it's the extra large, the xl.

474
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,295
Um, so it is a Japanese copy.

475
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:00,575
So keep in mind that it cannot play American based games.

476
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:04,215
It can only play three Ds games from the region it's from.

477
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,935
So in this case, it can only play Japanese three DS games.

478
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:08,255
If you had an American console,

479
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,615
you could play American based three DS games.

480
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,135
So kind of initially looking at the condition

481
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:15,255
of the console, there are some scratches in terms

482
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,215
of on the shell itself.

483
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,975
So you would probably need to get a cover

484
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,615
or replace the shell if this is bothering you.

485
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,935
Um, on the back as well, there's some wear

486
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,495
and tear, there's some markings here

487
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,855
as well as kind of like right here.

488
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,135
Uh, it's, it's been through quite a bit, you know,

489
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,575
three DSS were extremely popular in Japan,

490
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:32,775
so I'm sure this has been

491
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,015
through quite a few different journeys.

492
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:38,935
Um, the SD card slots does have an SD card in it, sorry,

493
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:40,135
was pointing at the microphone.

494
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:43,535
Um, I'll be sure to include a stylist as well.

495
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,255
The wireless buttons are working properly, same

496
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:48,405
with the three DS slider itself,

497
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:51,285
and then the shoulder pad buttons are working as well.

498
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:54,725
And it also does use the same charger as the DSI.

499
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:59,605
So that is a one thing to note. Um, no, no, no, no.

500
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,725
I, I'm seeing some questions about the, if you were

501
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,685
to use a charger with an American version system versus a

502
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:05,885
Japanese system, no, you're not

503
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:06,645
gonna have to worry about that.

504
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,685
Um, of course the plug might be a different type of plug,

505
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,885
but from what I remember, I believe it's the same type

506
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:16,645
of plug as the Japanese systems

507
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,445
or as the, I believe in Japan

508
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,445
and America, they have the same, the power scaling might be

509
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,925
different, but from what I remember, I think they charges

510
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,165
are the, are fine to use, uh, interchangeably.

511
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,165
So the volume wheel is also working.

512
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:30,565
And then the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack.

513
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,805
And then let's go ahead and open up the console itself.

514
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,525
So, uh, the, uh, circle pad is working fine,

515
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:37,965
the three DS slider

516
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:41,165
and the buttons are all responsive and not sticky.

517
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,205
So let's go ahead and turn on the console

518
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,985
seeing some questions about the, the camera itself.

519
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:49,745
Yes, don't worry. I will be sure to show off the camera.

520
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:55,005
Ah, there we go. Okay, so yes, so let's go ahead

521
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:57,365
and, yep, let's go ahead and ignore any news.

522
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,365
Let's go ahead and open up the camera first

523
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,485
and then I'll pop in a copy of Pokemon Moon to kind

524
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,285
of show off the gameplay

525
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:06,775
question about volume.

526
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,615
Yes, yes, of course. I will turn up

527
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:09,655
the volume, turn it down.

528
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:14,745
So let's see. Ooh, okay.

529
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:17,625
Oh, the 3D effects is in play, so, oh,

530
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,665
well that was making me sick.

531
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:21,825
Okay, so as we can kinda see the front facing camera, oh,

532
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,425
you can see a copy of Pokemon Moon right there

533
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,025
is working as intended.

534
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,465
You know, someone's like, hold up two

535
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:27,945
fingers, hold up your hands.

536
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,625
Yep, yep. You can see my hand

537
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,225
and then I will swap the camera.

538
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:35,835
It's taking a little bit. Ah, there we go.

539
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:38,235
Okay, so you can kind of see that. You can see myself.

540
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,235
Hello, I'm waving. Um,

541
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,675
and you can see that the camera is working.

542
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,475
Of course, it's gonna be a little laggy, you know, just

543
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:44,995
because it's just a different console.

544
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:46,595
Um, and then I will turn on the,

545
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,795
I don't know if you're gonna be able to tell the 3D effect,

546
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:51,435
but it is fully 3D oh,

547
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,035
and it is making me a little nauseated.

548
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,795
As you can tell, I never really fully had, uh,

549
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:57,155
the three DS effect enabled.

550
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,235
So, um, yes, it is, it is working.

551
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:02,595
Maybe you can see it that way. Uh, no you can't.

552
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:05,955
Uh, maybe okay. But yes, the 3D effect is working.

553
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,075
Um, so if you'd like to experiment with

554
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:09,355
that, absolutely go for it.

555
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,595
I think that would be a fun thing to do.

556
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,395
It just always made me a little sick to use it.

557
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:15,715
So, uh, I played the games for, uh,

558
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,155
or I played the consoles for the games.

559
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:21,115
Um, but yes, I'm, is the ees shop still working?

560
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,235
No, unfortunately they shut down the Nintendo ees

561
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,355
shop a little while ago.

562
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:25,955
Uh, so whatever you have on the

563
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,515
console is what you're gonna get.

564
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:31,395
Uh, unfortunately, uh, this is a clean slate copy.

565
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:34,035
Um, I'm not sure what would happen if you were to sign in,

566
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,595
if you had a three DS in the past

567
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:37,115
and you wanted to download games.

568
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,195
I believe the games themselves are also region bound, so,

569
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,915
um, even if you signed in with an American account,

570
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,725
I'm not sure what would happen if you were to do that

571
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,525
with a Japanese three DS xl.

572
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:53,015
I'm seeing some other questions. Can I port over?

573
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,175
Yeah, so we just answered that.

574
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,575
And does it come with any accessories?

575
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,895
No, and no other games as well.

576
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,735
Um, so I'm just using these games just to kind

577
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,615
of test the consoles, but unfortunately, um,

578
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,095
the games are not for sale themselves.

579
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:05,335
If you are interested in some of the games that I have,

580
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,455
yes, be sure to reach out.

581
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:07,615
Um, maybe, perhaps we can,

582
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,535
we can do a version with that later in the future.

583
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,475
So this is a brand new copy.

584
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,395
So, uh, remember all the, uh, Nintendo

585
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:17,155
or perhaps you don't know, uh, all the Nintendo copies, uh,

586
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,275
they do not save the data on the console themselves.

587
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,515
They save it on the cartridges.

588
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,595
So the cartridges themselves are what have the save data.

589
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:26,115
So in this case, this is a blank slate,

590
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,475
so it's not like there's something wrong

591
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,875
with internal memory of the system or there's no SD card.

592
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,675
Uh, it's just someone had reset this, uh, when they sold it,

593
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:35,395
because I purchased this in Japan when I

594
00:24:35,395 --> 00:24:36,475
was there last year.

595
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,765
So the cool thing about the Japanese games,

596
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,595
however, for three DS is you can change the language

597
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,995
so you can actually play the games and of language

598
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:49,915
and your desired language, including English.

599
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:52,715
So, so even though this is a Japanese copy of the game,

600
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:56,635
you can play this game in English on a Japanese three DS xl,

601
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,275
as you can kind of see right here.

602
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:00,035
So that's one of the cool things.

603
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:03,955
Um, just to kind of show off the three DS XL again, uh, oh,

604
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:04,995
lemme go ahead and turn on the volume.

605
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,505
I'll let this play for a little bit while ask any questions.

606
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:12,915
It's a little glaring. Can you turn off the lights?

607
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:16,905
Yes, of course. How is that a little better?

608
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,085
A little worse. Okay, let, let me, uh,

609
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,005
lemme just turn down the, uh,

610
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:21,845
the lighting a little bit then.

611
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:25,695
Oh, pretty low as is. Uh, oh, there we go.

612
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:28,095
I'll just make it a little brighter. Okay. That better? Yes.

613
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,655
Okay, that's better. Okay, cool. Fantastic.

614
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:32,525
I'm gonna go ahead and turn down the volume a little bit.

615
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:34,245
So yes, everything is responsive.

616
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:37,085
Um, I'll try to get into the game really quick so then

617
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,005
that way we can kinda show off the circle

618
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,205
pad and all the buttons.

619
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:41,845
Are there any other questions?

620
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:45,365
Um, I'm not seeing any other things. The 3D effect?

621
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:48,325
Yes, so I don't believe they enabled that

622
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:49,605
for the Pokemon games, just

623
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,405
because these were also released on the Pokemon,

624
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,325
on the Nintendo two dus.

625
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,405
If anyone remembers that, it's the flat version

626
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,525
of the three Ds, but there's no 3D capabilities.

627
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,685
Um, I think they, they did that with

628
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:00,845
that intentional purpose.

629
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:03,245
However, there's a lot of 3D game, Pokemon game,

630
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,285
or excuse me, three DS Nintendo games,

631
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,805
3D Nintendo games out there

632
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,565
that allow you to do such a thing.

633
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,865
So let me go ahead and just, unfortunately the,

634
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:15,385
the newer Pokemon games, there's a lot of, uh, handholding.

635
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:19,025
So they kind of, lemme just, let me just, do you know,

636
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:20,745
random stuff, exclamation points.

637
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:24,585
Sure. I'm not gonna say this anyways, so just

638
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,745
for demonstration purposes.

639
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:29,495
Um, so go ahead and answer any other questions.

640
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,455
Is the touch pad on the bottom responsive? Yes, absolutely.

641
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:34,415
Let me go ahead and show that off once I'm able

642
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:37,015
to get into the game and show off the touch pad.

643
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,935
Uh, I guess I should have mentioned that the two Ds,

644
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:43,015
the two Ds or the DSI also has a touch pad

645
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,365
that is responsive on the bottom screen as well.

646
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:48,045
Maybe I can show that off too while I'm waiting.

647
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,345
Get both of these in view a little bit.

648
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:53,825
Eh, it's close enough.

649
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:58,025
So as you can see, I can click on different things.

650
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:00,865
I, I will clean this, don't worry. Sorry.

651
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,665
Probably is bothering some people that I'm using my finger,

652
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:04,385
but I don't have the stylist on me off end.

653
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:06,505
There will be a silence included, so don't worry.

654
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,345
We'll go ahead and boot up the game.

655
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,065
Okay, so hopefully, I think we're about to get started.

656
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,105
It always takes a while with the newer generation of games.

657
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,785
Oh, maybe not. Oh yeah, there's more story.

658
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,625
Okay, well you guys are stuck here for a little bit more.

659
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,105
Uh, so lemme go ahead and answer some more questions.

660
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:27,065
Um, there's a play other games aside from Pokemon.

661
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,505
Yes, so I'm just demonstrating with Pokemon Games,

662
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:31,385
it's my favorite, uh, franchise to play.

663
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,465
So that's just the reason why, uh,

664
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,825
but it's also an easy indicator just

665
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,065
because a lot of people know about Pokemon

666
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,025
and the different, uh, generations and regions.

667
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:40,715
So go ahead

668
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:44,975
and start this, go

669
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:46,375
through the train conductor scene again.

670
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,135
I wish there was a way to skip. Can you skip the cut scenes?

671
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:52,575
No, unfortunately you cannot skip the cut scenes, um,

672
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,535
and emulators, which I do not.

673
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:58,695
You know, I, uh, we won't go into that, uh,

674
00:27:58,695 --> 00:27:59,695
but there are some fast forward

675
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:00,735
features that you're able to do.

676
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,575
So let me go ahead and continue. Onward blah, blah, blah.

677
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:07,555
And then lemme go ahead

678
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,595
and just skip past this just

679
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:10,155
to show off the two Ds touchscreen.

680
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:15,015
Lemme open up the menu and Pokemon

681
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:17,755
and then we can click on the different

682
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:19,895
summaries and things like that.

683
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:21,615
So the, the bottom touchscreen is working.

684
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,415
Um, I hopefully will be into the game soon

685
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,495
for on the right hand side.

686
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:28,775
And if you close the system, of course it's going

687
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,335
to pause the game as well, which is one

688
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,055
of the nice things about the Nintendo consoles.

689
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,355
Wanna answer some more questions?

690
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:38,395
We're about to wrap up soon.

691
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,355
Um, so if you're interested, be sure to kind of be sure

692
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,435
to check out the details that I've listed for each product.

693
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:45,635
Make sure that you click on them, review them.

694
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:49,155
I've included some mini videos as well as some screenshots

695
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,715
of the cons conditions.

696
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,515
So if you have any questions, please, please,

697
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:53,555
please be sure to let me know.

698
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:55,115
Um, does this come with a charger?

699
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:56,315
Yes, this does come with a charger.

700
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,995
Every console will come with chargers, except

701
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:59,155
of course for the game boy color.

702
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:02,235
This will not come with any con any con any, um, excuse me,

703
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,115
chargers because it takes AA batteries.

704
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:06,945
So that's the only one that will not come with that.

705
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,825
Um, I can include some, some batteries if you'd like.

706
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,025
Uh, however, I don't, I know some people are very particular

707
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,105
with the type of batteries they use.

708
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,105
I'm just using the, the Costco Kirkland branded batteries.

709
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:17,505
However, uh, you're more than welcome

710
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,945
to use whatever AA batteries you'd like.

711
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:21,385
Um, but every other console will come with a charger.

712
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:23,845
Yes, of course. Um,

713
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:25,565
lemme see if there are any more questions.

714
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:28,725
The condition of the 3D SXL again, can you show it?

715
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,845
Yes, of course. Uh, so I,

716
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,245
I'm just gonna be pausing the cut scene.

717
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,485
Um, so again, the shell has some

718
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:34,645
scratches on it on the front.

719
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,765
I would say the front is probably in its worst shape.

720
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,365
Um, the cameras themselves are working fine, um,

721
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,765
but there's just some markings kinda see here.

722
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:43,645
It's been, it's been through quite a bit.

723
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:46,485
Um, not as bad shape of the SP for sure,

724
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:49,685
but uh, it does have some markings here and here

725
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:53,085
and some shoulder pad buttons that are also working as well.

726
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:58,205
So there we go. Hopefully we will get to gameplay soon.

727
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,245
So then that way I can actually start showing the

728
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:02,365
buttons that are working.

729
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:07,345
Um, and I think of what else that you would like to know.

730
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,825
Um, oh yes, I think, hey,

731
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:10,025
I think we're about to jump in it soon.

732
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:12,385
Um, this was probably one of my,

733
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,745
actually I took a long break from Pokemon for a while,

734
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:15,905
I think after about gen three.

735
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:17,505
Got back into gen seven.

736
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:20,105
Someone had asked me what my favorite Pokemon gen was.

737
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,785
Uh, I would say, uh, Pokemon, uh,

738
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,345
gen two jo to was my favorite.

739
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,985
Um, I know, I know it's a, it's a pretty

740
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:28,665
millennial based answer, but it,

741
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:31,185
I I've started playing even like back in gen one,

742
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,025
but just gen two had both, you know, Jo to

743
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:35,105
and Canto, so absolutely amazing.

744
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:37,585
Okay, so we finally have control over a character.

745
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:39,425
So let's go ahead and move around.

746
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:43,025
So as you can kind of see the circle pad works, the dpad is

747
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,825
for Ride Pokemon in this game, so I can't show that off.

748
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:48,585
Maybe I can show that off in the home menu. Let's see.

749
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,885
This should, sometimes it takes a bit just with these games.

750
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:56,365
Yes, so the D pad is working just fine, um,

751
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,245
including like start

752
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:01,965
and select that is also reserved for other things as well.

753
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:03,525
To open up the menu, it's press X,

754
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,365
but I can show at least the touchscreen so

755
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:08,725
I can hit options, can change different things.

756
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,405
I can go back and it's a lot more responsive than the,

757
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,965
the DSI just, it's just better tech at the time.

758
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,765
Um, but as you can see, yeah, it's working great.

759
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:18,445
So I'm, I'm not seeing any other questions.

760
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,925
I'll give it a little bit more.

761
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:24,245
No, okay, so I think that is about it.

762
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:28,705
So lemme go ahead and do this. So there you have it.

763
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,865
So we've got four really amazing Nintendo, uh, consoles,

764
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,665
kind of really defining a legacy across a different years.

765
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:35,865
It's not every single one,

766
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,825
but remember it's the, the Game Boy color.

767
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:40,345
It's the Game Boy Advanced sp the Nintendo DSI

768
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,305
and the Nintendo three DS xl, the latter two, the DSI

769
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,585
and the three DS XL are both Japanese copies,

770
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:48,025
so please remember to remember that.

771
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:51,065
Um, but however you can play some of the Japanese games

772
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,065
that you have on your consoles and which is a cool thing

773
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,945
because sometimes the Japanese games are cheaper than the

774
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:59,265
American counterparts just 'cause they're in Japanese.

775
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,985
But you can play the, especially like the Pokemon games,

776
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:03,025
there are some three Ds games.

777
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:04,905
You can select the language to play in English.

778
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,145
So even though you have a Japanese copy, uh,

779
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:10,505
console does not mean you can't play games in English if

780
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:12,785
that is the language you wish to play it in, as well

781
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:13,825
as some other languages.

782
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:17,185
So, uh, make sure to add them to the cart, make sure

783
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,425
to review them, because remember, quantities are limited.

784
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,265
I only have, of course, you know,

785
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,345
this is the only quantity of each one.

786
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:25,865
Um, but I also do have some other consoles as you can kind

787
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:27,985
of see in the background behind me that will be going on

788
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:29,185
for sale later on at a date.

789
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:31,905
So be sure to check back if you're interested in, like,

790
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,585
for example, like the second dream.

791
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:35,305
Uh, nope, nope. Yeah, there we go. Nope.

792
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:36,385
Uh, uh, yeah, there we go.

793
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:39,605
The second dream cast as, or the, the game cube as well.

794
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,245
So if you're interested in those, be sure to let me know.

795
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,725
Stay tuned and yeah, feel free

796
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:47,925
to make sure you follow this channel or more retro gaming

797
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,445

798
00:32:50,105 --> 00:32:52,605
So I think that's about it, but, uh, we'll see you soon.

799
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:53,125
Thanks.
