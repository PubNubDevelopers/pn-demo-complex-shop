**01:50**
posters of MJ on my walls growing up in

**01:53**
Tennessee and and not having access to

**01:57**
sneakers as much as you know a huge

**02:01**
metropolitan area right you know I would

**02:03**

**02:11**
I used to every

**02:13**
cutting grass okay on on my street with

**02:16**
everybody so I could try to you know

**02:19**
save money up 10 bucks a lawn and I

**02:23**
would I would try to save up and save up

**02:25**
to go wait in line at Foot Locker and

**02:27**
I'll never forget when the the black and

**02:29**
around Olive nines maybe yeah yeah yeah

**02:32**
when they came out like we all wanted

**02:34**
those so good such an underrated pair

**02:36**
underrated pair well and also growing up

**02:39**
in a rural area it was a sneaker you

**02:41**
could wear and not feel so bad if it got

**02:44**
well it kind of looks like a Timberland

**02:45**
that's

**02:47**
yeah totally which when they winterized

**02:49**
that shoe I was like what took them so

**02:52**
long who who just thought of this right

**02:55**
before we're going to talk a lot of

**02:56**
Jordans but I really like early 2000s

**02:58**
cuz you were Weare ing kind of like Cool

**03:02**
Air Maxes you were really in like your

**03:03**
Air Max bag air max 98 oh yeah what

**03:07**
about like that Air Max era what do you

**03:09**
remember about that well it's kind of

**03:12**
ironic that the two sneakers that had

**03:14**
the most effect on me when I first saw

**03:18**
them were the threes okay and Air Max

**03:21**
yeah and same

**03:24**
find out that the same guy yes was

**03:26**
behind was the genius behind yeah your

**03:28**
boy now yeah well yeah yeah I have a

**03:31**
story yeah but yeah I went through a big

**03:34**
Air Max phase just because like super

**03:37**
comfortable shoe yeah um I have big

**03:39**
arches in my feet okay so I would wear

**03:42**
them on stage when I could because they

**03:44**
were they just supported my feet and

**03:46**
when they used to you know when they

**03:47**
first sold them they came with the

**03:48**
little the little wedge yep I remember

**03:51**
all this the arch W it was a styrofoam

**03:53**
it was blue and pink like that

**03:55**
to really save the arch you just threw

**03:57**
them out you threw them out with like

**03:58**
the gel that you can't eat the little

**04:00**
things that are pois I I I would spend

**04:01**
so much time trying to put them the

**04:04**
right way in the yeah so another moment

**04:07**
Big Pop Culture moment big Music Moment

**04:09**
do you know the significance of these do

**04:11**
you remember oh God think about

**04:15**
it where did I wear these byebye bye

**04:19**
video matching think the whole crew

**04:21**
matched that's right whole crew indiglow

**04:24**
14s 2000 they came out you matched them

**04:28**

**04:30**
greatest boy band of all time

**04:32**

**04:39**
like the best moments in music videos

**04:41**
and that made it oh wow it's definitely

**04:42**
like a sneaker culture moment this is a

**04:45**
deep cut this is like a bide on a Stevie

**04:47**
Wonder Al you know what I mean like gosh

**04:51**
you're right and we all had them very

**04:54**
good to dance and good com shoot and

**04:57**
then another thing I like back in the

**04:59**
day celebrity games charity games you

**05:01**
always brought it you always brought you

**05:04**
always brought it and it was like you

**05:05**
were wearing

**05:08**
shoes that like Dirk nitzky was wearing

**05:11**
right right so like and true blue 3es

**05:13**
what about those games that you remember

**05:15**
like I'm definitely going to wear dope

**05:16**
sneakers yeah yeah well also too I was a

**05:19**
big Penny fan okay Memphis right big

**05:22**
Penny Hardway fan getting the deposits

**05:25**
were were like a big deal too okay but I

**05:28**
never I don't think I ever was I could I

**05:30**
could ever find the blue and black was

**05:31**
always the white oral yeah the original

**05:34**
I think I was just at that time I was

**05:36**
mixing it up and wearing just like

**05:38**
anything that caught my eye got it

**05:40**
boxes coming in at that point uh no not

**05:43**
as much not as much not even for the

**05:46**
videos you think costume designer or

**05:48**
yeah my my yeah maybe okay yeah like if

**05:51**
there was a stylist or something we were

**05:53**
able to get what had just come out at

**05:56**
the time okay but um yeah yeah I I not

**06:01**
the plug that I have now okay

**06:04**
[Music]

**06:10**
okay we want to talk Legends Of Summer

**06:13**
Don't Throw yeah well I'm going to catch

**06:15**
you could throw Legends Of Summer these

**06:17**
are two yes yeah so this wrapped up yeah

**06:21**
one two three yeah yeah so we did we did

**06:23**
an all red one

**06:26**
this I don't even know how to describe

**06:28**
it we called them the Dorothy they look

**06:31**
like the the red slippers you know it

**06:33**
literally like somebody littered them

**06:35**
you know what I mean and um and yeah I

**06:37**
really wanted I mean the three has

**06:39**
always been one of my favorite shoes and

**06:41**
the two to me has always been the most

**06:43**
underrated that's what a lot of people

**06:44**
say of Jordans that's just my personal

**06:46**
opinion and so the color of this shoe is

**06:52**
actually the uh exact same color of the

**06:56**
stage Jay and I have put together for of

**07:00**
the summer so when I

**07:01**
stage it actually like almost

**07:04**
camouflaged itself makes sense and um if

**07:07**
you kind of look down on the bottom it's

**07:09**
got a reference to suit and Thai which

**07:11**
which was a song at that time suit and

**07:13**
Tai and holy grail and yeah I wanted all

**07:16**
different materials on all the pieces of

**07:18**
architecture of the shoe so and the

**07:21**
shoes you know we couldn't even Source

**07:22**
them you had to bring them you had to

**07:24**
bring them well yeah as you I said you

**07:27**
have them our friend mayor who had the

**07:29**
ones he hooked up the the two-color one

**07:32**
but you bought them from home because

**07:33**
these stores

**07:35**
sneaker doesn't even have them but you

**07:37**
also said you don't even have that many

**07:39**
pairs they're going for like $20,000

**07:42**
what happened to all your pairs I know

**07:44**
well a lot of my boys a lot of my

**07:46**
friends we had same same size okay so

**07:50**
when when uh you know Jordan brand made

**07:54**
me my sort of stash yeah of of them I

**07:58**
just wanted to share with all of my

**07:59**
friends and I think I literally only

**08:01**
have one pair of the all red ones wow at

**08:05**
home got to keep those I know I will it

**08:07**
will

**08:09**
[Music]

**08:16**
yeah all good Joe I'm good you're living

**08:19**
on the

**08:21**
don't think I ever dropped one wow I'm

**08:24**
going to drop the next one you just

**08:26**
that's like he hasn't miss a free throw

**08:28**
all night yeah CL

**08:31**
exactly we got to talk the Super Bowl

**08:33**
moment okay you debut these and this

**08:36**
pair is really special this is cuz these

**08:39**
right are but little different in the

**08:41**
details you if you notice these you get

**08:43**
the you get the Nike yes and this was

**08:46**
you know obviously if you know you know

**08:48**
it's you know if you know you know this

**08:52**
was the original design for the three

**08:56**
and that Tinker you know said you know

**08:58**
the jump

**09:00**
on its own and we should take the Nike

**09:03**
Swoosh off which I'm sure was very

**09:06**
controversial right conversation at the

**09:08**
time I I would not want to be in that

**09:10**
board meeting exactly but so we talked

**09:13**
about like what if we brought the

**09:15**
original design back for the Super Bowl

**09:18**
performance and I I said I'm good with

**09:22**
that as long as cuz it's the 3M but I

**09:25**
said but as long as it's the same color

**09:28**
as long as it's white cuz I wanted it to

**09:30**
be a detail and not like an overbearing

**09:35**
thing because that's how Tinker saw it

**09:37**
got it right

**09:39**
think they only made three pair of them

**09:42**
one for them to keep one for me to rock

**09:45**
and then one for me to stock so this is

**09:46**
the stock one and and the difference is

**09:48**
you get the date in the Super Bowl that

**09:52**
they were at and then they drop under 5

**09:54**
minutes they sell out what was it like

**09:56**
to see it s I mean you you were busy

**09:58**
obviously but

**10:00**
no Reggie Reggie from from Jordan hits

**10:03**
me and said the sneaker sold out and I

**10:06**
was like what he goes they sold out in 5

**10:08**
minutes I was like wait I was on

**10:09**
stage

**10:12**
so like the sneakers sold out quicker

**10:15**
then I could actually get back off the

**10:17**
stage and so yeah it was it was an it

**10:19**
was a cool moment and and even at that

**10:21**
time you know we were working on the man

**10:25**
of the woods kind of I call the Boot

**10:27**
three that's what I call it

**10:29**
right right yeah that so so it was funny

**10:32**
because two or three days before I

**10:36**
performed at the Superbowl I had a

**10:38**
meeting with with Mike a conference

**10:41**
meeting what was that like uh it was

**10:42**
great you know he said he really loved

**10:44**
what

**10:46**
thing with the man of the wood shoe was

**10:48**
I wanted it to feel like a boot I wanted

**10:50**
it to feel like that n little like a

**10:52**
winter Bo you know and um I was always

**10:56**
into the wallabies okay you know like I

**10:59**
was I was like how do we do like a

**11:01**
reference to the WABE so that's why we

**11:04**
did the leather laces okay you know and

**11:06**
obviously it came with the orange pop

**11:08**
that you could do as well but I just

**11:10**
wanted to have that sort of like boot

**11:12**
feel to it and the body of the of

**11:15**
shoe lends itself to that anyway yeah

**11:18**
but these are called the these are

**11:19**
called the higher hes which is a song

**11:21**
off that album and you know had a ET in

**11:24**
there and then you know on the inside

**11:27**
it's one Sho says is cruel and then the

**11:30**
other one says Fame is a lie love that

**11:33**
and also I want to talk about one night

**11:35**
in Beverly

**11:36**
Hills uh Barney okay that relates to

**11:40**
this a little bit okay is this a

**11:43**
reference yes yes

**11:46**
wow this is a reference and I see it and

**11:49**
I love it because it when you think of

**11:52**
like what goes into these designs you

**11:54**
think of

**11:55**
but a Sakai jacket at Barney's in

**11:58**
Beverly I had found this Sakai amazing

**12:02**
you know winter coat and I just love the

**12:04**
colors of it and I was like this feels

**12:06**
like the color palette to my my album

**12:10**
yeah and so yeah that was the coat that

**12:12**
inspired the shoe and I love it cuz

**12:15**
there's a little yellow on the hood and

**12:16**
there's even yellow in the eyelids yep

**12:18**
love that there's the there's orange

**12:20**
detail yellow yeah you got it man love

**12:23**
that going back just for a second to the

**12:25**
Super Bowl ones though you said you have

**12:27**
one to the the ones

**12:29**
stock one for them one to rock but you

**12:33**
were locked in but the C wait it's such

**12:36**
a sneaker head thing but I know I know

**12:40**
the that's why that's why I brought

**12:42**
those actually I thought maybe those but

**12:44**
those aren't the on right cuz no those

**12:46**
have zero creases okay the big I brought

**12:49**
that one big sneaker head thing but

**12:50**
listen you got the Super Bowl

**12:52**
performance that was a big conundrum for

**12:55**
me because I was like do I break these

**12:57**
in you know what I mean cuz I'm like am

**12:59**
I going to come off limping you know

**13:02**
what I mean or like

**13:03**
like the worst Tow Jam ever you went for

**13:05**
function I went well but only because I

**13:09**
had two hair okay you know what I mean

**13:11**
it's crazy cuz oh yeah you'll take an

**13:14**
Instagram photo and you're not like

**13:16**
tying your shoe all the comments are wow

**13:19**
the crease the crease the crease but

**13:21**
that's a major I feel like I do have to

**13:23**
defend myself right now there go there

**13:26**
was one for work and then there was one

**13:29**
that I was going to keep and uh another

**13:32**
thing yeah that was yeah that was funny

**13:34**
aggressive priest but you had another

**13:36**
one on Deck Tinker half

**13:40**
this we you know it's good that we're

**13:41**
ending here in this section cuz you said

**13:43**
that this was the first one the kid

**13:45**
cutting the grass you think this was one

**13:46**
of the first ones okay the first pair of

**13:49**
Jordans that I ever had I didn't buy

**13:52**
them they were they were given to me

**13:54**
okay and they were the fives with the

**13:56**
number on the heel okay this shoe there

**13:58**
was a girl that lived in The Cove of the

**14:02**
street that I lived in and she was like

**14:04**
2 years older than me I was in sixth

**14:06**
grade she was in eighth grade and she

**14:10**
was the

**14:12**
at our school and could who like wow for

**14:15**
real and I had the biggest crush on her

**14:18**
especially when I found out she had a

**14:20**
pair of Jordans she wore these Jordans

**14:22**
to play and so she literally gave me the

**14:27**
Sho what a story

**14:29**

**14:34**
